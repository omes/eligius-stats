eligius-stats
=============

These scripts generate statistics (xHTML pages and graphes) about the Eligius pool available at http://eligius.st/~artefact2/.

It requires PHP >= 5.3 with the curl extension, and Apache2 (other HTTPd may work too, if you rewrite the .htaccess yourself).

These scripts are distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.

Using the cli.update.php script
===============================

The data should be inserted in the JSON files at regular intervals, thus it is best to use cron jobs to do that. If
too much data is inserted, one point will represent less than a pixel on the graph, and the JSON files will take
a lot of space.

Recommended crontab :

0    * * * * /path/to/cli.update.php pool_hashrates

*/15 * * * * /path/to/cli.update.php balances random_addresses individual_hashrates top_contributors

*/3  * * * * /path/to/cli.update.php average_hashrates

*    * * * * /path/to/cli.update.php pool_status recent_blocks
